# FRST-Download-Update
A little utility to download or update Farbar FRST, to be referenced by my other project(s)

All credit for Farbar FRST goes to Farbar, Bleeping Computer, as per their website:
https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/farbar-recovery-scan-tool/

I am aware that sites like VirusTotal flags false positives for malware. It's not malware. The source code is right there in the au3 file. FRST itself raises similar false positives when scanned.
